## 1. Cost Efficiency and Licensing Flexibility

### Open-Source Advantage

Linux is free to use, modify, and distribute, eliminating licensing costs associated with Windows. Organizations can deploy Linux across multiple systems without incurring additional expenses, a significant benefit for startups and large enterprises alike.

### Licensing Freedom

The GNU General Public License (GPL) under which Linux is released allows for extensive customization and redistribution. This flexibility contrasts sharply with Windows' proprietary licensing, which restricts modification and can involve substantial costs for enterprise deployment.

## 2. Superior Security and Reliability

### Robust Security Architecture

Linux's permission-based model limits system access, reducing vulnerability to malware and viruses. The open-source community rapidly identifies and patches security flaws, ensuring a more secure environment.

### Stability Across Distributions

Distributions like **Debian** and **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** are renowned for their stability and long-term support, making them ideal for servers and mission-critical applications. Linux systems can run for extended periods without the need for reboots, unlike Windows, which often requires restarts after updates.
